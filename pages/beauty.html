        Because it can be a subjective ex-perience, it is often said that
        "beauty is in the eye of the beholder." Often, given the observation
        that empirical observations of things that are con-sidered beautiful
        often align among groups in consensus, beauty has been stated to have
        levels of objectivity and partial subjectivity which are not fully
        subjective in their aesthetic judgement.
